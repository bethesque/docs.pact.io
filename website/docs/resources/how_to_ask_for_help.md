title: How to ask for help on Slack
---

The Pact maintainers and our band of experienced community members love helping you learn how to use Pact! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Please remember that while you might be learning how to use Pact as part of your paid job, the maintainers and community are helping you _in their free time_. You can show respect for them and get an answer more quickly by following these steps when you have a question.

## 1. Search on docs.pact.io first

We have a great (free!) search tool provided by Algolia, and it's quicker than waiting for a human to respond. If you're trying to learn how to use Pact, check out our [Getting started](/getting_started/) section. If you're trying to learn how to use Pact *well*, check out our [Guides](/guides). If you're trying to learn how to use Pact in a particular language, check out our [implementation docs](/implementation_guides).

## 2. Search on Slack.

We're on a free plan, so we don't have unlimited history, however, you may be able to find the answer to your question in the archives.

## 3. Find the appropriate Slack channel for your question

If you can't find your answer on the docs site or Slack, _then_ ask your question on [Slack](https://slack.pact.io). If it's a general question about Pact theory or best practice, then feel free to ask it in the `#general` channel. For questions related to a particular language, please ask in the channel that relates to that language (eg. `#pact-jvm`, `#pact-js`). If you're new to the Slack workspace, you can browse the available channels by clicking on the `+` icon next to the `Channels` heading on the sidebar.

## 4. Ask a good question!

Imagine you were one of the people reading your question, and ask yourself if you have provided them enough information to give you a helpful answer. For technical issues, have you provided:

* A brief description of what you're trying to achieve, what your expected outcome is, and what the actual behaviour is.
* The relevant language and versions of the software you are using.
* Details of the environment you're using (Mac/Window/Linux, Docker).
* Example code.
* Any relevant logs.

#### Please remember

* The people who might be able to help you are often viewing your questions on their phones. Large slabs of unformatted text are hard to read. Please only supply the relevant text, and add three backticks (eg. ```) at the start and end so that it formats correctly. For large pieces of code please [create a snippet](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/slack-tips/share-code-snippets).  
* We are not a general purpose help desk! Using Pact requires:

    * strong development skills (writing code, using IDEs and text editors, operating command line tools)
    * a good understanding of how the APIs under test are implemented
    * understanding how to write, execute and debug unit tests
    * understanding how to use CI/CD software and build release pipelines

    While we will do our best to point you in the right direction, if you do not have these skills, we cannot teach you over Slack. Please find someone in your own company or the relevant technology community to assist you in these areas.
* Please do not direct message a maintainer (or anyone else) with a question unless specifically invited to. Asking questions in public channels allows more people answer and learn from your questions.

Thank you,

The Pact maintainers and community helpers üôè
