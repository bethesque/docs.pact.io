This project provides a command line interface to verify pact files against a running provider. It is a single executable binary. It implements the [V3 Pact specification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-3).

[Online rust docs](https://docs.rs/pact_verifier_cli/)

The Pact Verifier works by taking all the interactions (requests and responses) from a number of pact files. For each interaction, it will make the request defined in the pact to a running service provider and check the response received back against the one defined in the pact file. All mismatches will then be reported.

## Command line interface

The pact verifier is bundled as a single binary executable `pact_verifier_cli`. Running this with out any options displays the standard help.

```console
pact_verifier_cli v0.2.0
Standalone Pact verifier

USAGE:
    pact_verifier_cli [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --file <file> --dir <dir> --url <url> --broker-url <broker-url> --provider-name <provider-name>

FLAGS:
        --filter-no-state          Only validate interactions that have no defined provider state
        --help                     Prints help information
        --state-change-as-query    State change request data will be sent as query parameters instead of in the request body
        --state-change-teardown    State change teardown requests are to be made after each interaction
    -v, --version                  Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --broker-url <broker-url>                    URL of the pact broker to fetch pacts from to verify (requires the provider name parameter)
    -d, --dir <dir>                                  Directory of pact files to verify (can be repeated)
    -f, --file <file>                                Pact file to verify (can be repeated)
    -c, --filter-consumer <filter-consumer>       Consumer name to filter the pacts to be verified (can be repeated)
        --filter-description <filter-description>    Only validate interactions whose descriptions match this filter
        --filter-state <filter-state>                Only validate interactions whose provider states match this filter
    -h, --hostname <hostname>                        Provider hostname (defaults to localhost)
    -l, --loglevel <loglevel>                        Log level (defaults to warn) [values: error, warn, info, debug, trace, none]
    -p, --port <port>                                Provider port (defaults to 8080)
    -n, --provider-name <provider-name>              Provider name (defaults to provider)
    -s, --state-change-url <state-change-url>        URL to post state change requests to
    -u, --url <url>                                  URL of pact file to verify (can be repeated)
```

## Options

### Log Level

You can control the log level with the `-l, --loglevel <loglevel>` option. It defaults to warn, and the options that you can specify are: error, warn, info, debug, trace, none.

### Pact File Sources

You can specify the pacts to verify with the following options. They can be repeated to set multiple sources.

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-f, --file <file>` | File | Loads a pact from the given file |
| `-u, --url <url>` | URL | Loads a pact from a URL resource |
| `-d, --dir <dir>` | Directory | Loads all the pacts from the given directory |
| `-b, --broker-url <broker-url>` | Pact Broker | Loads all the pacts for the provider from the pact broker. Requires the `-n, --provider-name <provider-name>` option |

### Provider Options

The running provider can be specified with the following options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --hostname <hostname>` | The provider hostname, defaults to `localhost` |
| `-p, --port <port>` | The provider port (defaults to 8080) |
| `-n, --provider-name <provider-name>` | The name of the provider. Required if you are loading pacts from a pact broker |

### Filtering the interactions

The interactions that are verified can be filtered by the following options:

#### `-c, --filter-consumer <filter-consumer>`

This will only verify the interactions of matching consumers. You can specify multiple consumers by either seperating the names with a comma, or repeating the option.

#### `--filter-description <filter-description>`

This option will filter the interactions that are verified that match by desciption. You can use a regular expression to match.

#### `--filter-state <filter-state>`

This option will filter the interactions that are verified that match by provider state. You can use a regular expression to match. Can't be used with the `--filter-no-state` option.

#### `--filter-no-state`

This option will filter the interactions that are verified that don't have a defined provider state. Can't be used with the `--filter-state` option.

### State change requests

Provider states are a mechanism to define the state that the provider needs to be in to be able to verify a particular request. This is achieved by setting a state change URL that will receive a POST request with the provider state before the actual request is made.

#### `-s, --state-change-url <state-change-url>`

This sets the URL that the POST requests will be made to before each actual request.

#### `--state-change-as-query`

By default, the state for the state change request will be sent as a JSON document in the body of the request. This option forces it to be sent as a query parameter instead.

#### `--state-change-teardown`

This option will cause the verifier to also make a tear down request after the main request is made. It will receive a second field in the body or a query parameter named `action` with the value `teardown`.

## Example run

This will verify all the pacts for the `happy_provider` found in the pact broker (running on localhost) against the provider running on localhost port 5050. Only the pacts for the consumers `Consumer` and `Consumer2` will be verified.

```console
$ pact_verifier_cli -b http://localhost -n 'happy_provider' -p 5050 --filter-consumer Consumer --filter-consumer Consumer2

21:59:28 [WARN] pact_matching::models: No metadata found in pact file "http://localhost/pacts/provider/happy_provider/consumer/Consumer2/version/1.0.0", assuming V1.1 specification
