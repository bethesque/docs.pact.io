There are a couple of things that would make `Pact` even greater.

Right now we have a [Pact Mocha Interface](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-mocha) that does the hardwork of wiring up a server for you and gives a nice, readable Pact test. This interface works both on the `Consumer` side and on the `Provider` side.

There is a WIP for a [Jasmine Pact Interface](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-jasmine) which is to do the same thing.

Other tools such as ...
- Grunt
- Gulp
- Broccoli
- Jest
- Karma

... are also on the pipeline.

Karma can be used right now with both Mocha and Jasmine - check the `examples` folder.

If you have any requests for functionality, feel free to drop us a line on this repo or have a chat to one of us on the [Pact Slack workspace](https://slack.pact.io).
