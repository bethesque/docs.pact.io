[Pact JVM](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm) is currently compliant to Pact Specification Version [3.0](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-3).

Head to the [README](jvm/readme) to get started with Pact on the JVM \(Java, Scala, Clojure etc.\).

For a Scala specific implementation, there is [Scala-Pact](scala) from the folks at ITV. This is Pact Specification Version [2.0](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-specification/tree/version-2) compliant and supports SBT and ScalaTest.

## Getting Started Guide

This [workshop](https://github.com/DiUS/pact-workshop-jvm) walks you through an example problem from start to finish, exploring most concepts that Pact supports. It takes approximately 2 hours to complete.
